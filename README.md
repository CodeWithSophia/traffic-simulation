## Project Overview
This project implements an **intelligent traffic management system** for a T-intersection using Python and PyGame. The system optimizes traffic flow by:
- Reducing unnecessary waiting time
- Minimizing traffic redundancy
- Decreasing time delays
- Improving fuel efficiency

### Key Features

### 1. **T-Intersection Model**
   - Realistic 3-way intersection simulation
   - Proper lane markings and road structure
   - Visual traffic flow representation

### 2. **Intelligent Traffic Lights**
   - Adaptive signal timing based on traffic density
   - Red → Stop, Yellow → Prepare, Green → Go
   - Reduced green time when traffic is light
   - Extended green time during heavy traffic

### 3. **Smart Vehicle Behavior**
   - Vehicles stop at red lights
   - Slow down at yellow lights
   - Accelerate at green lights
   - Maintain safe following distance
   - Proper turning mechanics at intersection

### 4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Real-time statistics display
   - Average waiting time calculation
   - Fuel consumption monitoring
   - Comparison with fixed-time systems
